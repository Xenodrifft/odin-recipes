        <!-- Chicken Pelau Description -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pelau is one of Trinidad's most popular dishes, says Prime, chef and co-owner of Cane, a restaurant in Washington, 
            D.C. that pays tribute to the multifaceted influences in the cuisine of the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago. 
            The layers of flavor in Chef Prime's pelau come from a range of sources: Zesty, spicy Green Seasoning, plenty of 
            coconut milk, a hit of ketchup and Worcestershire, and an ingenious technique of sauteing both the beef and the rice 
            and pigeon peas in a scorched caramel to create a rich texture and nutty taste. The sugar also helps balance the 
            chiles' heat, creating a dish that demands bite after bite.

        <!-- Pelau directions -->
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toss together beef with 1/2 cup Green Seasoning and 1 tablespoon of the pepper sauce in a medium bowl until 
                combined; cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>In a 10-quart pot, stir together 6 tablespoons turbinado sugar and 1/4 cup oil until combined. Cook over 
                medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until sugar turns dark brown and begins to foam, about 4 to 5 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to medium and immediately add marinated beef and any remaining marinade. Cook, turning pieces 
                occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup onion, remaining 1 cup Green Seasoning, 
                and garlic and cook until onion is slightly translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and remaining 1 tablespoon of pepper sauce and cook over medium heat, 
                stirring occasionally and adding 3 to 4 cups water as needed, a cup at a time, until beef is mostly tender, 
                about 30 to 40 minutes. (The meat should have a little bit of liquid around it; you will know to add more water 
                if the meat starts frying instead of simmering.) Remove pot from heat and transfer beef to a large bowl using a 
                slotted spoon; pour cooking liquid into a separate large bowl. Clean the pot and return to the stove.
            </li>
            <li>Combine remaining 6 tablespoons turbinado sugar and remaining 1/4 cup oil in cleaned 10-quart pot and cook over 
                medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until sugar turns dark brown and begins to foam, about 4 to 5 minutes. 
                Add pigeon peas, rice, and remaining 1 cup onion and cook, stirring constantly, until onions are translucent 
                and mixture is coated with caramelized sugar, about 5 minutes; season with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon 
                pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Stir together reserved cooking liquid from the meat with coconut milk, adding water to mixture as needed to equal 
                8 cups total. Add meat and cooking liquid mixture to rice mixture and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce 
                heat to low and stir in Scotch bonnet and bay leaves; season with remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and remaining 3/4
                teaspoons pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Cover and cook until liquid is completely absorbed and rice and beef are tender, about 35 to 40 minutes; serve 
                immediately. (The "bun bun" at the bottom of the pot is a special treat.)
            </li>
        </ol>
