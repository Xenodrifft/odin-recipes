        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Trinidad is known for its small family-owned Bakeries that offer a wide selection of fresh bread along with local 
            savory and sweet treats. One sweet treat that will make many Trini people salivate at the thought of them is Currant 
            Rolls. This sinful pastry is made with currants wrapped and rolled between buttery, flaky pastry layers. The texture 
            is a mixture of the crunchy outer crust with the soft chewing inner layers and fruity bursts of currants. The flavors 
            are just as layered as the pastry, with sugar, butter, currants, and spices coming together in a symphony for your 
            taste buds. This recipe is a must-have for any sweet pastry lover and home baker for all these reasons.

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>Mixing Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add flour, salt, sugar and cake margarine to a mixer bowl.</li>
            <li>Run the mixer for 2 minutes at a slow speed. Then add water, and mix at fast speed for 5-8 minutes until dough is 
                glossy and pliable.
            </li>
            <li>Move dough to the lightly floured table and fold rectangular. Cover with plastic.</li>
            <li>Rest dough for a minimum of 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread puff pastry margarine evenly and tightly on wax paper to 7" x 9", leaving about 2" between the edge of 
                margarine and paper.
            </li>
            <li>Spread dry flour on the work area on the table and roll dough to rectangular shape approximately 11" width x 15" 
                length.
            </li>
            <li>Dust off-dry flour and place pastry margarine on top of dough 1" from the right-hand edge. Also, maintain 1" from 
                top and bottom. Squeeze margarine tightly downwards onto the dough.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Fold #1</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fold unbuttered side (left) to lap fully over half buttered area. Then fold the right side over this fold to 
                meet in the center. Fold both together, the right side completely covering the left side (like a book). Pinch 
                edges to lock margarine in.</li>
            <li>Lift dough, flip over (right becomes left), and rotate 90 degrees with open ends facing you.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Roll #1</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>With a rolling pin, roll dough across width to 16". Then roll longitudinally, working from the center towards 
                both ends; keep shape rectangular. Roll to 16" wide x 24" length.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Fold #2</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a book fold.</li>
            <li>Rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Encased in plastic.</li>
            <li>Remove from the refrigerator, spread dry flour on the table, turn dough over and rotate 90 degrees with open 
                ends facing you.
            </li>
            <li>Roll #2 as before.</li>
            <li>Fold #3 as before. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Repeat Roll #3 and Fold #4. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove, cut into 2.</li>
            <li>Roll out each to approximately 12" wide x 24" long. Wet all ends with a pastry brush.</li>
            <li>Combine currants, cinnamon and sugar and spread half of the mixture evenly onto dough.</li>
            <li>Starting at the top end, and along the entire length, fold dough 1/2" over currants, and then continue rolling 
                across full width.
            </li>
            <li>Stick the free end to the dough properly along the length and place this join under. Using a fork scratch along 
                surface length. Also pierce the roll with a fork throughout the entire length, 2" apart.
            </li>
            <li>Cut roll to length of sheet pan.</li>
            <li>Place on a buttered sheet pan.</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 350 Degrees F. Bake for 45 minutes or until lightly golden brown.</li>
            <li>Quickly brush with simple sugar water glaze (Combine 1/2 cup water, 1 cup sugar and bring to boil). Sprinkle with 
                white sugar over the top.
            </li>
            <li>Replace in the oven and bake for another 5 to 10 min or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and cool while still in the sheet pan.</li>
            <li>Slice in 1 1/2" thickness in diagonal cuts.</li>
        </ol>
