        <p>There's nothing like standing at the side of the road and using your hands to inhale the soggy mess of savory 
            deliciousness known as the Trinidad Doubles. One of the most famous Trinidad street foods, Doubles, is commonly 
            associated with breakfast or late-night bar crawls. Made with cooked chana (also known as chickpeas) placed on 
            top of two bara (two fried flatbread) and finished with various local condiments depending on what side of the 
            road you find yourself. Cucumber chutney, Tamarind chutney, Chadon Beni Sauce, and pepper sauce are some of the 
            condiments used to add depth of flavor and heat to this dish. This fun, hands-on dish will make your next social 
            gathering flavorful and interactive.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Bara Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a medium-sized bowl combine all the dry ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the warm water, stirring with your fingers until the dough is formed with a slight stickiness to it.</li>
            <li>Coat the dough with some coconut oil and place into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the bowl & place it onto a clean surface; divide the dough into 24 even pieces, grease your 
                hands with coconut oil and roll each one into a ball, placing them onto the lined tray. Cover with a clean kitchen
                towel and let rest for 1 hour. 
            </li>
            <li>Heat the remainder of the oil in a pot on the stovetop or deep fryer, heat to 350 Â°F</li>
            <li>Using an oiled plate, stretch out each piece of dough using your fingers, don't worry if the dough gets any holes.</li>
            <li>Fry each of the dough for 1 minute per side, place the dough onto a lined tray or bowl to keep warm and drain the 
                oil while you fry off the remainder of the dough.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Chana (Chickpea Curry)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the soaked chickpeas well using a strainer under warm water.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with 1 liter of water and place it on high heat to boil, add in the chickpeas turning the heat 
                down to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>Cook until chickpeas are softened for 20-30 minutes, skimming the foam from the surface with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Add in the garlic, turmeric, garam masala and chadon beni leaves and salt continue to cook for another 10-15 
                minutes. Mix back and forth using a wooden spoon and slightly crushing the chickpeas to thicken the chana. 
                Once thickened turn off the heat and set aside to cool. 
            </li>
